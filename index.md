# Ableton @ GitHub

Ableton provides a set of libraries and tools for third party developers. You can find the
open source repositories on our [GitHub organization page](https://github.com/ableton).
Two of our libraries have restricted access and may require licensing: Link and Live Set
Export.

[Ableton Link](/link) is a technology that synchronizes musical beat, tempo, phase, and
start/stop commands across multiple applications running on one or more devices. It comes
in two flavors:

- [LinkKit SDK for iOS](/linkkit) LinkKit provides a C / Objective C interface for the use
  on iOS. Usage of LinkKit is governed by the [Ableton Link SDK
  license](https://github.com/Ableton/LinkKit/blob/master/LICENSE.md). By using LinkKit
  you agree to its terms and conditions.

- [Link cross-platform source code library](https://github.com/ableton/link) Link is an
  open source cross platform C++ library. It is dual licensed under GPLv2+ and a
  proprietary license. If you would like to incorporate Link into a proprietary software
  application, please contact [link-devs@ableton.com](mailto:link-devs@ableton.com).

[Ableton Live Set Export](/export) is a library that allows an application to write
Ableton Live project files. Currently only ALSExportKit for iOS is available. It is
governed by the [ALS Export SDK License](/export/assets/ALSExport_License_v1.0.pdf). To
get access to ALSExportKit please register
[here](https://www.ableton.com/en/link/sdk/license-request/).


The [third party plugin developers portal](/plugins/) contains
resources to help developers make their plugins work well in Live.
