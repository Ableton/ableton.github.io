# Ableton @ GitHub

Ableton provides a set of libraries and tools for third party developers. You can find
the open source repositories on our [GitHub organization
page](https://github.com/ableton). Two of our libraries have restricted access and may
require licensing: Link and Live Set Export.

[Ableton Link](/link) is a technology that synchronizes musical beat, tempo, and phase
across multiple applications running on one or more devices. It comes in two flavours:

- [LinkKit SDK for iOS](/linkkit) LinkKit provides a C / Objective C interface for the use
on iOS. Usage of LinkKit is governed by the [Ableton Link SDK
license](/linkkit/downloads/Ableton_Link_SDK_License_v2.0.pdf). To request access to
LinkKit please register [here](https://www.ableton.com/en/link/sdk/license-request/).

- [Link cross-platform source code library](https://github.com/ableton/link) Link is an
open source cross platform C++ library. It is dual licensed under GPLv2+ and a proprietary
license. If you would like to incorporate Link into a proprietary software application,
please contact [link-devs@ableton.com](mailto:link-devs@ableton.com).

[Ableton Live Set Export](/export) is a library that allows an application to write
Ableton Live project files. Currently only ALSExportKit for iOS is available. It is
governed by the [ALS Export SDK License](/export/assets/ALSExport_License_v1.0.pdf). To
get access to ALSExportKit please register
